Requirements

This asset uses TextMeshPro for demo UI elements.
Please ensure TextMeshPro is installed in your project:
	â€¢	In Unity: Go to Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essentials

Unity will automatically prompt you to do this when opening the demo scene if TMP is not yet installed.

On older versions of Unity you may need to use the PackageManager accessible through the "Window->PackageManager" drop down menu.
