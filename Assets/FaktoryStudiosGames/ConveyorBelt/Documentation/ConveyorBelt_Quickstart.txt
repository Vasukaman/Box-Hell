# Quickstart Setup Guide

*** TextMeshPro is required to view text in the demo scene -- It can be installed via the package manager or from the "Window->TextMeshPro->Install TMP Essential Resources" in the Unity drop down menu in newer versions of Unity. ***

1. **Add the Component**
   - Attach `ConveyorBelt.cs` to an empty GameObject.
   OR
   - Create a conveyor from the 'GameObject->3D Object->Conveyor Belt' drop down.

2. **Assign the Material**
   - Use any material that supports `_BaseMap` UV offset.

3. **Adjust Shape**
   - Set Width (Z), Height (Y), and Length (X) to define size.
   - Increase Corner Segments for smoother ends.

4. **Set Extrusion Detail**
   - Use Segments to control mesh resolution.

5. **Enable UV Motion**
   - Set UV Scale U/V and Scroll Speed.
   - Use Scroll Curve to animate speed changes.

6. **Configure Physics**
   - Toggle 'Move Objects in Trigger' if desired.
   - Objects with rigidbodies will move with the belt.

7. **Audio Feedback**
   - Optionally assign Start, Stop, and Running audio clips.

8. **Visual Debugging**
   - Enable 'Show Gizmos' to visualize conveyor direction and trigger zone.

9. **Control at Runtime**
   - Use Inspector buttons to Start ⏵ or Stop ⏸ the belt manually.

NOTE: Trigger size will need to be bigger than conveyor -- adjust the Y size in the conveyor inspector if there's no movement.
